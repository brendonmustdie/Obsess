     <p className='mb-4'>“Can artificial Intelligence Make Art without Artists”, by Sofian Audry and Jon Ippolito, tries to mediate the argument that machines “have some degree of creativity” (Leonel Moura) with the argument that machines cannot be ascribed creativity (Harold Cohen). (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) Before deciding that they’re asking the wrong questions. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019)</p>
     <p className='mb-4'>
     Harold Cohen, who’s been working with “algorithmic art” since 1968, and built AARON, a machine that produces drawings and paintings, argues that the creativity of the artwork comes from the dialog between program and programer, not from the machine alone. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) In this way, he frames the “artistic potential” of machines through their interactions with humans. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019)
</p>
<p className='mb-4'>The idea is echoed in “The Machine as Artist as Myth” by Andreas Broekmann, “…the recent stundt of the Artifical Intellgence-based ‘Next Rembrandt’ painting was made possibly by decased of art-historical and technical research on the painter’s works…”. (Broekmann, 2019) In this way, Broekmann argues that  AI artworks cannot exist without previous artworks to draw from. (Broekmann, 2019)
</p>
<p className='mb-4'>Leonel Moura, who began experimenting with AI in the 90’s, makes art by releasing a swarm of robots onto a canvas, each armed with ink and a colour senser. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) He argues that anything can be considered art if validated by an art world mechanisms. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) While Moura doesn’t really mention AI art being interpreted as an artist, his definition of art leaves it open to interpretation. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019)
</p>
   
<p className='mb-4'>Audry and Ippolito bring up an interesting concept: “the ‘artist’ as it matters for art history is not the actual person but the construct that lives in the minds of work’s beholder.” (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) And part of this concept is Foucault’s idea that readers can infer the qualities of the author without knowing anything about them. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) (Which sounds like a load of bullsh*t, until you think about J.K. Rowling’s transphobia, neo-liberal, racist, anti-semitic Harry Potter - or Edgar Allen Poe’s obsessive, paranoid, nervous, sad….everything.)</p>
<p className='mb-4'>In this way, we can think about wheter the machine gives rise to the “artist’s function” the image of the artist as created by the viewer. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019) The nature of the artist and meta-artist (”the author of the author of the works.”) vary depending on conclusion the audience draws from their experiences. (Audry, S., Ippolito, J., 2019)</p>
<p className='mb-4'> “The Machine as Artist as Myth” by Andreas Broekmann suggest that the idea of the “machine” is a product of a false narrative in which humans and technical systems are antagonistic. (Broekmann, 2019)
</p>

<p className='mb-4'>The idea of “machine as artist” is not new, or reliant on AI, we can see from “Machine Art”, displayed in MoMA in 1934. (Broekmann, 2019) Part of the idea of machines as artists is the idea that a machine takeover is on the horizon. (Broekmann, 2019)</p>
<p className='mb-4'>Broekmann seeks to define artists, and the role of the artist, before confronting the question of whether machines can be artists at all. (Broekmann, 2019) Referencing various Readymade artworks, and the Dada movement, Broekmann concludes that AI art will not “end or destroy” art. (Broekmann, 2019)</p>
   <p className='mb-4'>One part of this paper that really struck me is the idea that artists continue to make art, even after the death of art. (Broekmann, 2019) </p>h2 className='font-semibold t
<p className='mb-4'>Broekmann defines the machine as a “myth” in a “functional sense of the term” - he understands the myth as a belife that is widely held - is repeated, and affirmed, and in this, is powerful. (Broekmann, 2019)</p>  
<p className='mb-4'>He includes what he believes to be the myth of the machine, but summarizes it as “…always this one story of something man-made being fucntional and then gaining a dangeous, nonlethal form of autonomy.” (Broekmann, 2019) When humans refer to items as machines, they call on the myth of a machine - attributing to it an inherent threat. (Broekmann, 2019)</p>
<p className='mb-4'>Because referring to the machine references this myth, it obstructs our discourse about art and it’s relationship to technics.  (Broekmann, 2019) </p>
